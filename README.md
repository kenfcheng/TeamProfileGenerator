# Description

This project runs in Node and is a in-command-line way of adding user profiles into an app browser-free. An HTML will be generated for the profiles. Upon initializing command the user will be prompted to answer the following.

1. Team Member's Name
2. Team Member's Role
3. Team Member's ID
4. Email Address
5. Phone Number (If Manager)
6. School (If Intern)
7. GitHub Username (Engineer)
